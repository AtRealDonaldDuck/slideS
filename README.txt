The executable to run this file is found in slideS\flikrSlideshow\bin\Debug
and is titled FlickrSlideshow 1.0.exe.

If you haven't created a preset and/or haven't clicked a preset before clicking the start button the application will crash.

You create a preset by pressing the + button on the left.

After doing so you can customise your preset, animation time refers to how long the fade out animation will take,
transition time refers to how long the current image will stay on screen and galleryID is to specify the
flikr gallery the images will be sourced from, you can press the [...] button next to it to be brought to 
flikrs gallery browsing page to get a flikr galleries ID you have to go to the galleries page and get the id from its url
for example the ID of "https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries/72157717649882136/" would be "72157717649882136"

SlideS makes use of the FlikrAPI.
